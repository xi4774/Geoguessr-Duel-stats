  Display duels stats:
    * Graph ELO Evolution: Graph of your ELO evolution since the chosen date

    * Stat duel opponents: Number of games, winrate and ELO variation for each opponent (ID).

    * Some overall stats: Worst Losing/Best Winning streak, number of games vs banned
players (when import occurred), ELO variation related to banned players, 
Winrate vs banned players, Overall winrate

    * Histogram opponent's ELO distribution: repartition of opponent's ELO. 
For each bar, considered ELO are between the mean of the current value and the precedent 
AND the current value and the next one (minus 1).
Example : for 1000, opponent's ELO is between 950 and 1049.
For 800 and 1600, considered ELOs are < 850 and > 1575.
The red part represents lost games and the green one won games.

    * Stats duel countries: Stats for each country you played. Number of rounds, winrate, 
mean distance in the country, mean difference with your opponents, mean guess time.
A map below the histogram represents your winrate by country. 

    * Record by opponent: Each game you played against the selected opponent showing
the decisive round, your best round and your worst.

    * Stats by opponents nationality: Number of games, winrate and ELO difference for each
opponent's nationality. The nationality the opponent had when playing.
